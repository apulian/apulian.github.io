I am Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics of Universit√† degli Studi di Bari "Aldo Moro". My research interests lie primarily in the broad areas of (Numerical) Linear Algebra and (Numerical) Dynamical Systems. The emphasis of my work in Linear Algebra is on eigenproblems (and singular value problems) where the matrix depends smoothly on one or more parameters. In Dynamical Systems, I am interested in continuation of multidimensional manifolds of solutions, detection of bifurcations, and on the existence of solutions that exhibit special behaviours (such as blow up or extinction in finite time). See my Research page for more information.
