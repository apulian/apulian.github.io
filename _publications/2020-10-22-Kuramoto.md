title: "A note on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with discontinuity"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/kuramoto
excerpt: 'In this work we consider differential equations of the type $$\pm u(k)^{(k)}=f(u)$$, and study the extinction profile of their solutions. Emphasis is placed on the special case $âˆ’u^{(4)}=\mathrm{sgn}(u)$, which is related to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. In this case, we describe in more detail the extinction phenomenon and prove a conjecture by Galaktionov and Svirshchevskii.'
